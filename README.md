# hello-world

As an almost 60-year-old Boomer, I feel privileged to become part of this coding community
My coding started with Q basic on a dos' computer at 16 MHz and with large really floppy disks
1Mb ram was considered an upgrade
I never dived deep into coding, only to be interested in its possibilities' en developments
As a physics teacher, I've always been drawn to the creative aspect of being able to write your own software.
Some friends were really caught up by this coding, from assembly on upwards
As the coding hardware developed and the coding software evolved, my interest is once more there.
The revolutionizing development of AI systems make me want to keep in touch with its development
Not in the least for the moral and ethical consequences of it.
So I started studying python, dived into software testing.
Wrote some coding.
Now I'm preparing to find my way into a community so large it dazzles me.

That's me
