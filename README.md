# hello-world

as an almost 60 year old Boomer i feel privelaged to become part of this coding community
My coding started with Qbasic on a dos computer at 16 Mhz and with large really floppy disks
1Mb ram was considered an upgrade
I never dived deep into coding, only to be interested in it's possibilities en developments
As an physics teacher i've always been drawn to the creative aspect of being able to write your own software.
Some friends were realy cought up by this coding, from assembly on upwards
As the coding hardware developed and the coding software evolved my interest is once more there.
The revelutionizing development of AI systems make me want to keep in touch with it's development
Not in the least the least for the moral and ethical consequences op it.
So I started studiing python, dived into software testing.
wrote some coding.
Now i'm preparing to find my way into a community so large it dazzels me.

That's me
